This is a new file, to try out how to edit it and stage and then continue to edit it. What happens?

I staged the file, and then I made changes to the file.

When using "git status", this is what I got:

$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   TestingStaging1.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   TestingStaging1.txt


I then added the file, committed, and pushed it. The pushed file was the one with the latest changes.

When a file is added, it will be staged. If it is then edited afterwards, the file is unstaged again.

Here are some more changes.
